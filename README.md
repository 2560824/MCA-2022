# Music Curation and Analytics
## Week 1
The Theme for my dataset will be Debussy and the late Romance era. Debussy was a French composer born in the late 19th century and became one of the most influencial composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He created a very distinctive harmonic and musical structure that, in many ways, embodied the principles of the Impressionist painters and writers of the day. 

I believe that some of the challenges to working with music related data could be collecting the metadata as Debussy, although well known, composed his music more than 100 years ago, therefore collecting accurate metadata could pose as a challenge. 

Currently, the manifestations of data relating to Debussy is curated is through descriptive, notated and acoustic data.

### Descriptive Data
Most of Debussy's compositions can be found on streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple music along with video sharing platforms such as Youtube. 
### Notated Data
Many of his works can be found as printed scores on websites such as the International Music Score Library Project and other online archives. 
### Acoustic Data
