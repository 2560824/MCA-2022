# Music Curation and Analytics
## Week 1
The Theme for my dataset will be David Bowie. David Bowie was an English singer, songwriter and actor. He was an iconic figure of the 20th and 21st century and possibly one of the most influencial musician of the music industry. 

I believe that some of the challenges to working with music related data could be collecting the metadata. Although well known,many of Bowie's works have been remastered and reworked, therefore collecting accurate metadata could pose as a challenge. 

Currently, the manifestations of data relating to Bowie is curated is through descriptive, notated and acoustic data.

### Descriptive Data
Most of Bowie's songs can be found on streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple music along with video sharing platforms such as Youtube. 
### Notated Data
Most of his documented works can be found as printed scores on websites such as websites like musicnotes and various other online archives as well as compilations of his work on printed booklets sold by various companies. 
### Acoustic Data
Live performances of Bowie's music can, again, be found on streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and Youtube. 

## Week 2&3
In week two and three, I downloaded sheet music of David Bowie's 'Heroes' from 'the piano notes' and converted the sheet music into a musescore project. I then edited the project so that it would look as similar to the initial sheet music as possible. In week three, I exported the musescore score into MusicXML and then attempted to export to MEI. 

## Week 4
In week four, I attempted to generate a jSymbolic analysis of 'Heroes' by David Bowie and then chose a set of elements that I felt were the most interesting and appropriate for my specific piece. I then attempted to use the Python notebook on the Moodle to generate a piano roll and pitch histogram of 'Heroes' using music21.

## Week 8
In week 8, I gathered 3 separate music tracks named: Music Manic's 'Never Thought I'd Fall In Love', Mindseye's 'Summer Breeze' and Adeline Yeo's 'Scratch My Mind' in the musical stylings of House,IDM and breakcore respectively. I collected these music tracks from the website 'freemusicarchive.org'

## Analysis
The main advantage of time-frequency analysis over waveform analysis is the ease with which significant information about the particular musical composition may be extracted. A waveform evaluation, in contrast, has a lot of data but does not display it in a way that is clear to the human eye. Although it omits the necessary numbers, it does in fact give us information about the song's intensity at any given time, and the wave shape shows us how often the frequency fluctuates. For example, in the spectogram and waveform of 'Never Thought I'd Fall In Love', the spectogram shows the general shape of the song, letting us know an estimate of how it sounds whereas the waveform only shows dynamics or, more generally, the level of sound throughout the composition.
