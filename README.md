# Music Curation and Analytics
## Week 1
The Theme for my dataset will be David Bowie. David Bowie was an English singer, songwriter and actor. He was an iconic figure of the 20th and 21st century and possibly one of the most influencial musician of the music industry. 

I believe that some of the challenges to working with music related data could be collecting the metadata. Although well known,many of Bowie's works have been remastered and reworked, therefore collecting accurate metadata could pose as a challenge. 

Currently, the manifestations of data relating to Bowie is curated is through descriptive, notated and acoustic data.

### Descriptive Data
Most of Bowie's songs can be found on streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple music along with video sharing platforms such as Youtube. 
### Notated Data
Most of his documented works can be found as printed scores on websites such as websites like musicnotes and various other online archives as well as compilations of his work on printed booklets sold by various companies. 
### Acoustic Data
Live performances of Bowie's music can, again, be found on streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and Youtube.
